- **Real-time Dashboard**: Track documents, leads, and earnings in one place

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT** for authentication
- **SendGrid** for email notifications
- **AWS SDK** for DigitalOcean Spaces integration
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **Helmet** and **express-rate-limit** for security

### Frontend
- **React 18** with React Router
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API requests
- **React Toastify** for notifications

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization
- **MongoDB** database
- **Nginx** for serving the frontend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- MongoDB (if running without Docker)
- SendGrid API key
- DigitalOcean Spaces account (or AWS S3 compatible storage)

### Environment Variables

1. Copy the environment example files:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

2. Edit `.env` and `backend/.env` with your actual configuration:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure random string for JWT signing
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Your SendGrid API key
   - `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: Verified sender email in SendGrid
   - `DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT`: DigitalOcean Spaces endpoint (e.g., nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com)
   - `DO_SPACES_KEY`: DigitalOcean Spaces access key
   - `DO_SPACES_SECRET`: DigitalOcean Spaces secret key
   - `DO_SPACES_BUCKET`: Your Spaces bucket name

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

1. Start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - MongoDB: localhost:27017

3. Stop services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Running Locally (Development)

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend API will run on http://localhost:5000

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

#### MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017, or update the `MONGODB_URI` in `backend/.env`
